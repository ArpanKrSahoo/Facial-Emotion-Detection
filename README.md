# 🎭 Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection

A **real-time facial emotion recognition system** that detects human faces through a webcam and classifies emotions using a **trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The project uses **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face detection and **deep learning** for accurate emotion prediction.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 Real-time face detection using webcam
- 🧠 Emotion classification with a pre-trained CNN model
- 👤 Haar Cascade-based face detection
- 🏷️ Displays bounding box and predicted emotion label
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight real-time inference

---

## 😊 Supported Emotions
The system recognizes **7 different emotions**:
- 😠 Angry  
- 🤢 Disgust  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😄 Happy  
- 😐 Neutral  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😲 Surprise

## 🧠 Working Pipeline
1. Capture live video stream from the webcam  
2. Detect faces using Haar Cascade Classifier  
3. Preprocess face regions (grayscale, resize, normalization)  
4. Predict emotion using trained CNN model  
5. Display emotion label with bounding box in real time
